OneExBit trading terminal. From reading charts to adding exchange accounts and making transactions - we will guide you step by step. OneExBit is a great choice for novice traders because you can have all your accounts in one place and switch between them instantly. Our interface is intuitive and easy to learn even for beginners. Plus, it’s free! We know how daunting it can be for a newbie to see a standard trading interface with its charts, candlesticks, orderbook, and so on. So before we tell you how to register on exchanges and add your trading accounts into the terminal, let’s get to know the OneExBit program first. Don’t worry, we won’t overload you with information – we’ll do it in small bite-sized instalments. In this chapter, we’ll see how to view prices for various cryptocurrencies on different exchanges . You don’t need to have any trading account to do this – though you do need to be online. So, in your home window of OneExBit, look in the top left corner. You’ll see the name of the currently selected currency pair (ETH/BTC) in this example) and exchange (Bitfinex). This means that the chart you’re looking at shows the price movements of the ETH/BTC pair on Bitfinex. OneExBit has 10 major integrated exchanges, and we’re working on adding more. Let’s switch to Binance for now. Click on the name of the exchange, and a drop-down menu will appear. Choose Binance. You’ll instantly see the chart changing radically. It’s not surprising, since the default pair has changed, too – in this case, to BTC/USDT. Now click on the pair to get to the currency pair menu. The BTC/USDT pair can be found in the Stable section, because USDT is a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. Let’s say you’re not interested in trading USDT but would rather prefer ETH/BTC. You’ll find it in the BTC section – click on it. In the Price field, you’ll see how much BTC you would get for 1 ETH on Binance right now – in this case, 0.021845 BTC. Remember that the exchange rate always indicates how much of the second currency (the one after the slash) you’ll get by selling one unit of the first currency. This seems obvious when you look at the exchange rate in a pair like ETH/BTC – because Bitcoin is so much more expensive than any other crypto. But try switching to the Altcoin tab and look at a pair like BTCU/SDS. Here you need to remember how to read the rate: for 1 BTCU, you’ll get 7 945.630 SDS. Also, don’t forget that the exchange rate for each given pair will differ from one exchange to another. The number under the price shows how much the exchange rate has changed in the past 24 hours – in green,if it’s gone up, and in red if the price has gone down. By default, pairs in the list are sorted by decreasing volume, with ETH/BTC being the most traded BTC pair on Binance. You can click on the words Name, Price, and Change to sort the list in different ways, both in decreasing and increasing order. Here’s what we’ll get by sorting the list of BTC pairs by price in decreasing order (that is, with the currencies that are more expensive relative to BTC on top): Note that by clicking on Change, you can see which coins have grown or fallen most in the past 24 hours. In some cases, this might give you an indication of which coins could be a good buy. When you want to find a specific pair, you don’t have to scroll through the whole list. Just enter the name of one of the currencies in the Search field. Let’s say you are looking for REN/BNB – just type ren. Once you’ve located the pair you need, you can click on the little star to add it to your watchlist – this way you won’t need to do the search again in the future. Check the Watchlist tab to see that the pair has been added: We encourage you to play with the list of currency pairs: switch between different exchanges and explore which pairs they offer! Also note how exchange rates for the same pair differ – and how much the volume can vary. You’ll see that some exchanges lean heavily towards certain pairs. That’s it for today, folks – next time, we’ll see how the orderbook works! If you have any questions, post them in the comments or get in touch with us on Telegram .

From reading charts to adding exchange accounts and making transactions - we will guide you step by step. OneExBit is a great choice for novice traders because you can have all your accounts in one place and switch between them instantly. Our interface is intuitive and easy to learn even for beginners. Plus, it&#x2019;s free! We know how daunting it can be for a newbie to see a standard trading interface with its charts, candlesticks, orderbook, and so on. So before we tell you how to register on exchanges and add your trading accounts into the terminal, let&#x2019;s get to know the OneExBit program first. Don&#x2019;t worry, we won&#x2019;t overload you with information &#x2013; we&#x2019;ll do it in small bite-sized instalments. In this chapter, we&#x2019;ll see how to view prices for various cryptocurrencies on different exchanges . You don&#x2019;t need to have any trading account to do this &#x2013; though you do need to be online. So, in your home window of OneExBit, look in the top left corner. You&#x2019;ll see the name of the currently selected currency pair (ETH/BTC) in this example) and exchange (Bitfinex). This means that the chart you&#x2019;re looking at shows the price movements of the ETH/BTC pair on Bitfinex. OneExBit has 10 major integrated exchanges, and we&#x2019;re working on adding more. Let&#x2019;s switch to Binance for now. Click on the name of the exchange, and a drop-down menu will appear. Choose Binance. You&#x2019;ll instantly see the chart changing radically. It&#x2019;s not surprising, since the default pair has changed, too &#x2013; in this case, to BTC/USDT. Now click on the pair to get to the currency pair menu. The BTC/USDT pair can be found in the Stable section, because USDT is a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re not interested in trading USDT but would rather prefer ETH/BTC. You&#x2019;ll find it in the BTC section &#x2013; click on it. In the Price field, you&#x2019;ll see how much BTC you would get for 1 ETH on Binance right now &#x2013; in this case, 0.021845 BTC.

This time, we’ll look at the main element of the interface – the chart. The standard trading chart you see when you open the terminal is the so-called candlestick chart. Candlesticks are those green and red vertical bars. Each of them can tell you a lot about the price movement within a certain period of time. At the top, you can see which exchange you are working with (Bitfinex) and which currency pair you’re looking at (BTC/USD). Note that there’s also the current (last) price, the lowest and highest price reached within the last 24 hours, as well as the trading volume: At the top left of the chart, you can choose between different time frames: Minutes: you can select 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, or 30 minutes; Hours: choose between 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, or 12 hours; Daily (1D); Weekly (1W); Monthly (1M). The key thing to understand is that one candlestick always represents one unit of time in your chosen timeframe. If you select 15 minutes, then each candlestick will show you data for a 15-minute period. If you select 1 day, then each candlestick will represent 1 day. The data used to generate the chart is still the same, but on larger time frames, more data is compressed into each candlestick. A period of one hour on a 5-minute chart will consist of 12 separate candles, but on a 1-hour chart, it will all fit into one candle. Just above the chart on the left, but below the timeframe selectors, you’ll find the values of the opening (O) and closing (C) price for the selected period, as well as the highest (H) and lowest (L) price reached in that period. As you move the cursor along the chart, you’ll see which exact period you are looking at. For example, in the following two screenshots we are looking at October 26 and October 27. Note that the O, H, L, and C values change as you go from one candle to the next. Now let’s look at the color and structure of a candle. You’ll see that most of them have a thicker “body” (known as wax) and then a sort of a needle sticking out from the top and the bottom. These needles are called shadows: the one at the top is called a wick, and the one at the bottom is called a tail. The top and bottom edges of the body (wax) represent the opening and closing price. How do you know which is which? From the color. A green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, so that the trend was positive. Conversely, a red candle shows you that the price went down. The wick and the tail point to the highest and lowest price reached during the selected trading period. OneExBit trading terminal allows you to combine several charts in the same window. To switch between different layouts, use the icons at the top right of the chart: You can choose between a single large chart (default), two charts arranged horizontally or vertically, four charts, or one full-screen chart (to exit the full screen mode, press Esc). The circular arrow refreshes the charts. So now you know the basics of working with standard candlestick charts in OneExBit. Next time, we’ll look at other types of charts you can use – including line, bars, and hollow candles. If you still haven’t tried our trading terminal, you should do so asap!
